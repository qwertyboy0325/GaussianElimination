# Command Line Tool README

This command line tool provides functionality for performing Gaussian Elimination operations on matrices, running performance tests, and reading matrices from files.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this command line tool, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- C++ compiler that supports C++17 standard
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Compilation

To compile the command line tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/qwertyboy0325/GaussianElimination.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd GaussianElimination`
3. Compile the source code: `g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o command`

## Usage

The command line tool supports the following commands:

1. `test -p/--performance`: Run performance test
   - `-p/--performance`: Run performance test with the following options:
     - `-t/--print`: Print performance results
     - `-f/--file <filename>`: Export performance results to a CSV file
   - `-r/--random <OutputQuantity> <MatrixScale>`: Run random test

2. `input`: Execute input command

3. `read <path1> [<path2> ...]`: Read and process provided paths

4. `help`: Display help message

To run a command, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, execute the following command:
./GaussianElimination.exe <command> [options]
Replace `<command>` with the desired command and provide any necessary options.

## Examples

1. Run performance test and print the results:
